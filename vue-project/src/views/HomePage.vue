                A video game, sometimes further qualified as a computer game, is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device 
                (such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device) to generate visual feedback from a display device, most commonly shown in a video format on a television set, 
                computer monitor, flat-panel display or touchscreen on handheld devices, or a virtual reality headset.<br><br> Most modern video games are audiovisual, with audio complement delivered through 
                speakers or headphones, and sometimes also with other types of sensory feedback 
                (e.g., haptic technology that provides tactile sensations). Some video games also allow microphone and webcam inputs for in-game chatting and livestreaming.<br><br>
                Video games are typically categorized according to their hardware platform, which traditionally includes arcade video games, console games, and computer (PC) games; the latter also encompass LAN games, online games, 
                and browser games. <br><br> More recently, the video game industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablet computers), virtual and augmented reality systems, and remote cloud gaming. 
                Video games are also classified into a wide range of genres based on their style of gameplay and target audience.<br><br>

                Interactive software that is used for entertainment, role playing and simulation.  Video games are played on a Windows PC, mobile device or specialized gaming console such as an Xbox or PlayStation. <br><br>
                Due to the ever-increasing speed of today's CPUs and graphics cards, games have become extremely realistic, not only in their animation but in their themes.<br><br>
